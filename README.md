# Survey Builder

The Survey Builder project is a Java application aimed at creating and managing surveys with role-based access control, robust exception handling, comprehensive documentation using JavaDocs and OpenAPI, adherence to programming principles, and serialization and deserialization of JSON objects. This project enables users to design, distribute, and analyze surveys efficiently while ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility.

## Key Features

### Role Based Access Control
- Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and restrict access to survey creation, distribution, and analysis functionalities based on user roles (e.g., administrator, survey creator, respondent).

### Exception Handling
- Employed robust exception handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and exceptional conditions during survey creation, distribution, and analysis processes. Ensured informative error messages and appropriate error recovery strategies.

### Documentation with JavaDocs and OpenAPI
- Utilized JavaDocs to generate comprehensive documentation for the codebase, including class, method, and field-level documentation.Also integrated OpenAPI to create a RESTful API documentation for seamless integration and interaction with external systems.

### Programming Principles
- Adhered to programming principles such as SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) to ensure clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

### Serializing and Deserializing JSON Objects
- Implemented serialization and deserialization of JSON objects to efficiently store and retrieve survey data. Utilized libraries like Gson or Jackson for seamless conversion between Java objects and JSON representations.

### Data Modeling
- Designed robust data models to represent survey structures, questions, responses, and user roles. Implement data modeling techniques to ensure data integrity, consistency, and flexibility in survey design and analysis.
